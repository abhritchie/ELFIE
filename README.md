# Environmental Linked Features Interoperability Experiment (ELFIE)

## Summary
The ELFIE is intended to test existing OGC and W3C standards with the goal of establishing a best practice for exposing links between and among environmental domain and sampling features. The IE is focused on two cross-domain use cases: 1) exposing topological and domain feature model relationships between features and 2) description of sampling data available for and linked to sampled domain features While addressing these use cases, the IE will strive to address issues of encoding data as specific views of a linked data graph that would be passed between systems. These linked data graph views are expected to support archictures involving linked data catalogs and registries. For example, data providers can use the linked data graph views as a way to advertise their monitoring or domain features to catalogs or other applications that want to crawl and index available data. Similarly, integrated catalogs that index and construct links between features can use the views as a linked data response to search queries.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate the use of existing and pending OGC standards for the encoding of environmental observation data in an integrated dataset of features linked according to ReSTful and Linked Data principles. 
- Prepare an OGC engineering report summarizing the groupâ€™s findings with the intention of future development of the relevant policies, best practices or implementation standards.
- Provide draft linked data encodings to be considered by relevant standards working groups.

## ELFIE Expectations to be Tested
**Long Term Vision**  
We think we can eliminate the need for ad-hoc one-off mappings between non-standard feature types with best practices that entail a well known set of semantics and feature models that allow automated traversal and interpretation of linked information.
  
**Specific Near Term Expectations**  
We think we can express connections between features in an ostensibly open world using existing technologies and data models.  
  
This includes basic spatio-tempoal topological links, monitoring relationships, and domain feature model connections.  
  
We think that use of resources resolved according to a view of a linked data graph will allow us to create documents that could be built from formal linked open data yet are compatible with basic REST/JSON pattern.
