# Environmental Linked Features Interoperability Experiment (ELFIE)

## Summary
In recent years, environmental domain feature models have been established by a number of sub-domain groups. However, there is no best practice or standard methodology to encode documents containing links between and among domain features, such as a rivers, aquifers, or soils, and observational data about those features. A common approach to encoding such links is required to allow cross-domain and cross-system sharing and interoperability of such linked information.

The Environmental Linked Feature Interoperability Experiment (ELFIE) will bring interested stakeholders together around the shared goal of providing a best practice for encoding documents expressing links between hydrologic and related features from models including but not limited to HY_Features, GWML2, and SoilIEML as well as observations and related content from a variety of observations and monitoring standards. The IE will produce an OGC engineering report summarizing the overall cross-domain inter-standard findings and recommendations for a best practice and/or standard to follow. This report will include encoded examples that should feed future linked-data encoding implementation standard development in one or more related standards working groups. To keep scope limited, this IE will not test service interfaces or processing capabilities that would necessarily exist to create or consume the data and documents being tested. The IE is informed by a number of existing systems, examples included with use cases, that offer or could offer services that would benefit from a linked feature data-encoding best practice.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate the use of existing and pending OGC standards for the encoding of environmental observation data in an integrated dataset of features linked according to ReSTful and Linked Data principles. 
- Prepare an OGC engineering report summarizing the groupâ€™s findings with the intention of future development of the relevant policies, best practices or implementation standards.
- Provide draft linked data encodings to be considered by relevant standards working groups.
