# Environmental Linked Features Interoperability Experiment
The ELFIE is intended to test existing OGC and W3C standards with the goal of establishing a best 
practice for exposing links between and among environmental domain and sampling features. The IE is 
focused on two cross-domain use cases: 1) exposing topological and domain feature model relationships 
between features and 2) description of sampling data available for and linked to sampled domain features 
While addressing these use cases, the IE will strive to address issues of encoding data as specific 
views of a linked data graph that would be passed between systems. These linked data graph views are 
xpected to support archictures involving linked data catalogs and registries. For example, data providers 
can use the linked data graph views as a way to advertise their monitoring or domain features to catalogs 
or other applications that want to crawl and index available data. Similarly, integrated catalogs that 
index and construct links between features can use the views as a linked data response to search queries.
