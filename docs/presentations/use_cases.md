Environmental Linked Feature Interoperability Experiment (ELFIE) Use Case Overview

Purpose, Analysis, Implementation, and Demonstration

Introduction
========================================================

Use cases used to drive many aspects of the project.

Analysis:
- Scoping and early architectural discussion 
- Analysis of data and existing interfaces
- Understanding real world users and implementers

Implementation:
- Driving requirements for implementations
- Contextualizing demonstration of outcomes

Example Analysis Use Cases
========================================================

### Treated as if we were planning to implement. 
We were delusional, but it made for great discussion.

- River network linked data to address hydrologic drought and ecology
- Flood risks and impacts
- Water quality impacts monitoring of mining activities
- Surface water impacted groundwater level forecasting

Implementation Use Cases
========================================================

Simple index of hydrography and observations for a watershed
  Watershed Boundary, hydrographic network, stream gage, water quality
  Compiled into a simple map viewer

Implementation Use Cases
========================================================

Visualization of watershed and water budget data.
  Watershed boundary, hyrographic network, outlet location, stream gage, and water budget time series
  Built into a visualization suited to a broad audience

Implementation Use Cases
========================================================

BRGM SW/GW Linked Data Round Trips
  Waterbodies, watersheds, aquifers, wells, and streamgages
  Visualized in a linked feature data / graph viewer (BRGM Linked data Viewer)
  
Implementation Use Cases
========================================================

USGS Prototype Station Pages
  hydrolocation type and basic feature identification info
  Working toward modern station pages experimenting with linked feature content

Implementation Use Cases
========================================================

US/Canada Groundwater Surfacewater Interoperability Pilot
  Catchments, aquifers, wells, stream gages, waterbodies
  Visualized in an experimental app for a cross border data exchange
  
Implementation Use Cases
========================================================

SensorThings based observational data index
  Sensors and features they observe
  implented in a prototype system for discovery and access of sensorthings based data
  
Demo Time!
========================================================

When ELFIE is complete, [this presentation](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ELFIE/demo/use_cases)
will include links to demonstration applications.
