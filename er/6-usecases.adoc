== Use Case Summary

=== Introduction
ELFIE design work was directed by a number of use cases with
extensive need for linked environmental data. These use cases are either
hurdles to systems they maintain or would be nice additions to systems they
rely on as users. Many of these use cases were described and used for
discussion and vetting of ideas only, others were taken further with
implementation of example encoded linked data documents and client code to
visualize data involved in the use case.

The full suite of use cases considered durring the design phase of the
project are described below. Each use cases takes the form of a simple
description of who or what system has an interest in what related datasets.
Specific datasets are listed to clarify the scope and provide a starting
point for technical design work. Use cases that were implemented as
demonstrations of the design outcomes are described in more detail to include
notional diagrams of how datasets involved link to each other, a thorough
description of the use case, and an example application that speaks to and/or
satisfies the needs of the use case.

=== Use Cases Considered in Design Process

and economic impacts of additional water use.

water quality monitoring locations and data * Water quality sampling
locations and data * Mine locations * Snowpack and runoff * River flow

bridges, and various observations for situational awareness and model
calibration/validation.

furthermore to the acquired observation (timeseries).

*Relevant datasets*::: * Groundwater wells description * Piezometer description *
*Groundwater levels at piezometer level

**Surface-ground water networks interaction**:: Management of the pressures on
natural resources requires properly linking domain features not only using
surface/ground water interaction at a local level but also taking benefit of
the broader river networks and aquifer systems connectivity.

*Relevant datasets*::: * Borehole/Well * Piezometer (+ associated observations)*
*Aquifer * AquiferSystem * Aquifer/River interaction * River Network * River
*gage (+ associated observations)

**Surface water impacted groundwater level forecasting**:: A groundwater
extraction modeler needs information about surface water that replenishes
groundwater so they can understand and forecast groundwater availability.

*Relevant datasets*::: * Groundwater wells and level data * Surface water
monitoring sites and flow data * Meteorological monitoring sites and
observations * Output predictions at groundwater prediction wells

=== Use Cases Implemented as Demonstrations of Outcomes

**Water budget summary** This use case provides a person interested in a
basic summary of the water budget for a given watershed information about a
collection of watersheds and their water budget data. It links together
various hydrographic representations of each watershed as well as
observational water budget data and related web resources.

As shown in the <<img_uswb_data>>, the watershed feature is linked to various
representations of it. This follows the HY_Features concept of a catchment as
an _unrealized_ feature that is related to various realization features,
there is no canonical representation of the watershed its self.

available on the

page.]

**Watershed data index** This use case is meant to demonstrate the use of
HY_Features to link a catchment (12 digit hydrologic unit code (HUC12)
watershed in this case) to the data representing it as well as the monitoring
network associated with it. It serves as a general demonstration that could
be used for a wide array of linked watershed information use cases.

**Flood risks and impacts** This use case provides a decision maker needing
to respond to flooded transportation infrastructure the information they need
to understand the impacted assets and flooded roads for a forecast flood.
Under this use case, a flood forecasting system would be able to discover
vulnerable infrastructure and assets published by local juridictions as
linked data and publish flood forecasts that include potentially impacted
features in forecast information products.

// Sylvain 20180516 -> Dave : did you demonstrate this one ? Because from BRGM
// this one was not For the moment I commented it

// **Surface water impacted groundwater level forecasting** This use case tests
// the ability of established data models to link surfacewater and groundwater
// features and observations for applications like recharge estimation from
// rivers or water supply source selection. The implemented solution is a
// collection of rich linked data documents showing how features, observations,
// and related data can be encoded in JSON-LD.

**Ground water level monitoring** This use case is meant to demonstrate how from
a given Well URI any user (domain expert, machine) can then traverse to the
monitoring strategy deployed and then access to the ground water level time
series. Further than advocating the linked data approach it serves as a
demonstration artifact on how typed information can trigger type-specific data
viewer (here map and time series).

implementation is available on the

**Surface-ground water networks interaction** This use case is meant to
demonstrate how from a given Piezometer URI any user (domain expert, machine)
can traverse to the ground water monitoring strategy (see Ground water level
monitoring Use Case) but also to the associated surface water monitoring one.
Provided each surface/groundwater features are propertly linked together (River
network, Aquifer system) it is then feasible to acquire knowledge about a fully
comprehensive water system. This use case can be seen as a flagship one to
demonstrate the usefulness of linked data in the environnemental context.
