== Applicable Best Practices and Standards

=== Introduction

The approach taken in the ELFIE was limited in contrast to recent IEs concerning environmental information models. The ELFIE focused on linked data documents that contain collections of linked features and related observations. With regard to the OGC Reference Model, this IE seeks to understand how features (geospatial information, observations) can be linked to each other in specific resolved views of the linked data graph or by reference through use of HTTP URIs. The ELFIE did not seek to solve problems regarding network architecture for resolving links or systems design and governance for applications that store and retrieving links or concept relationships.

Given this, the ELFIE sought to define a common approach to encoding links between environmental domain features that would allow cross-domain and cross-system sharing and interoperability of such linked information. To do this, the ELFIE worked with existing and pending OGC standards for encoding of environmental observation data in an integrated dataset of features. Such OGC data models were then linked together according to W3C and other Linked Data best practices.

=== OGC Web Standards

OGC Web Service standards for features and observations (WFS and SOS respectively) were used to construct HTTP URLs for use in the ELFIE linked data documents as much as possible. While the WFS and SOS APIs present some challenges in creating URLs for use in linked data, the APIs do offer sufficient HTTP GET functionality to embed useful content in linked data with a great degree of flexibility. Issues related to URL structure and a given API-call’s relation to a canonical non-information resource URI were encountered but deferred for future investigations.

=== OGC Domain Models

OGC data models were used extensively in the ELFIE. The Observations and Measurements (O&M) conceptual model provided a high level organizing framework for most the ELFIE documents. The OGC-W3C Spatial Data On the Web Working Group implementation of O&M (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA)) was used directly because of its applicability to the linked data technology pursued in the ELFIE. The GeoSPARQL ontology was also used directly for representing geometries and spatial relations between features.

Domain specific data models such as WaterML2 Part 3: Surface Hydrologic Features and WaterML2 Part 4: Groundwater Markup Language 2 (GWML2) were also used for feature types and relations in the ELFIE linked data documents. 

.Use of Unformalized Identifiers
********************
A major limitation for use of these data models in the ELFIE was a lack of published taxonomies and ontologies using stable namespaces. Placeholder URIs were minted for their feature types and relations for the ELFIE project and formalization of such taxonomies and ontologies was left for future work.

Not all URIs used in examples in this project are not intended to be stable. Formal publication of these ontologies will supercede interim choices.

=== W3C

W3C best practices for data on the web, spatial data in the web, and linked data were used to guide decisions related to the ELFIE linked data documents. Several members of the ELFIE project team were involved in development of these best practices and represented them throughout the project. Given this, the ELFIE was an opportunity to apply these best practices in a practical engineering process, using them together and attempting to apply them to OGC web service and information models.

This was largely successful and no major issues were encountered related to the best practices themselves. However, they were not achieved fully due to realities of the internet, organization’s operational constraints, and limitations of current APIs and data models. In other words, a project seeking to apply OGC standards on their current infrastructure within the suggested W3C best practices would find it very difficult or expensive to achieve them.

Experiences from the ELFIE project are being taken forward into influencing future W3C standards through the Data Exchange Working Group, where the concept of views is being addressed within the scope of the profiles concept. Description, discovery, metadata and negotiation according to formally identified profiles mirrors the ELFIE architectural choice to publish and reuse JSON-LD contexts.

=== JSON-LD

Given the ELFIE goals related to adoptability of solutions and support of mass market search techniques, JSON-LD was used as the encoding for the ELFIE documents. While there were other potential options that could be used, the ease of use (parsing and serialization) of JSON-LD across practically all programming languages made it the clear choice for use in the ELFIE. The decision to use JSON-LD was further supported by ongoing work within the OGC Architecture Domain Working Group to modernize OGC standards to support more data types beyond XML, especially JSON. As described below, some technical limitations inherent to RDF and thus JSON-LD were encountered while attempting to encode preview geometries, but all basic requirements of the ELFIE were satisfied by the JSON-LD encoding.

The incompatibility of JSON-LD and GeoJSON is a finding that will need further consideration by the OGC community.
