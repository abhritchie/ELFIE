[NOTE]
.Instructions
===============================================
This section explains some concepts frequently required by Asciidoc novices. Please use this file as a template for your own clauses.
===============================================

=== Headlines
All headlines are marked by "=" signs. The top level in each each file starts with level 2 ("=="). Important: For whatever strange reason, headings in annexes are marked differently.

=== Figures
If you want to reference a figure by using a figure number, it is important to use the following syntax. The figure identifier for <<img_overviewSimple>> is the first statement of the header. Please adapt the width as appropriate.

[#img_overviewSimple,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.High level architecture of Testbed-13
image::images/t13.png[width=800,align="center"]

It is important that you use the same syntax for all images, otherwise the automatic numbering is corrupted!

=== Recommended Asciidoc Environment
We recommend to use http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor] and http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] in combination with the https://atom.io[Atom] editor.

In Atom, you should install the following packages:

* asciidoc-preview
* autocomplete-asciidoc
* language-asciidoc
* markdown-writer
* platformio-IDE-terminal

This environment allows you to use keyboard shortcuts, autocomplete, syntax highlighting and a rendered preview for asciidoc; and provides you an terminal window within the editor to convert your asciidoc to html and pdf.

=== Asciidoc Conversion
In order to achieve a uniform look-and-feel of all ERs in both HTML and PDF, we have provided a css and theme file. The following commands can be used to convert the ER:

* asciidoctor er.adoc for HTML
* asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-stylesdir=resources -a pdf-style=ogc -a pdf-fontsdir=resources/fonts cfp.adoc

=== Asciidoc(tor) Syntax Help
Is available e.g. here: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/

=== Citations
Please use the following syntax to insert citiations:

cite:[VanZyl2009]

Then you need to provide all citation information in the file resources/bibtex-file.bib. Everything else is done automatically.
