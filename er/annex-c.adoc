== Use Cases Considered in Design Process

**River network linked data to address hydrologic drought and ecology**::
Water consumers and decision makers are interested in potential ecological
and economic impacts of additional water use.

*Relevant datasets*::: 
* River network
* Incremental catchments
* Low flow and temperature sensitive species distributions
* Monitoring locations
* Low flow and temperature forecasts
* Ecological stream classification
* Historical streamflow characteristics
* Flow and temperature regulations

**Stream water quality and quantity monitoring**:: Water consumers are
interested in ambient stream characteristics and water quality impacts of
water allocation decisions.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* River network
* Monitoring locations
* Water quality data
* Water quantity data
* Water allocation information
* Diversions and discharges

**Flood risks and impacts**:: A person in a flood-impacted area needs
information about the risks to them for a forecast or ongoing flood event.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* River network
* Stream flow and stage forecasts
* Topography
* Flood depth and extent data for event
* Flood plain map(s)
* Flood control assets
* Impacted transportation assets
* At risk critical infrastructure

**Water quality impacts monitoring of mining activities**:: A water quality
analyst needs to know what data is available to assess baseline and impacted
conditions of a waterbody impacted by mine-related runoff.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* River network
* On network waterbodies
* Realtime water quality monitoring locations and data
* Water quality sampling locations and data
* Mine locations
* Snowpack and runoff
* River flow monitoring locations and data

**Cross border monitoring index**:: An analyst working in a cross border
watershed or aquifer needs information characterizing their study region from
another country of jurisdiction.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* River network data
* Catchment data
* Aquifer data
* Streamflow monitoring locations and data
* Aquifer monitoring wells and data

**Water budget summary**:: A person interested in a basic summary of the
water budget for a given watershed needs information about the watershed and
its water budget data.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* Watershed boundary
* Watershed outlet location
* Water budget component data
* Links to additional information

**Watershed data index**:: A person with a stake in the conditions of a given
watershed needs an index of all water-quality related information about the
watershed.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* Impaired (e.g. polluted or degraded) waters
* Drinking water quality violation reports
* Facilities with discharge permits
* Water quality infrastructure investments
* Watershed characteristics
* Modeled data such as nutrient concentrations

**Flood monitoring at bridges**:: A jurisdiction with significant
infrastructure near or over waterways needs a system to link waterways,
bridges, and various observations for situational awareness and model
calibration/validation.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* River network
* Bridge inventory
* Monitoring stations and data
* Locations where model results are available

**Flood Impact Study**:: A hydrologist conducting a flood impact study needs
to collect relevant information from various agencies.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* River network
* Watershed boundaries
* Hydrologic locations of vulnerable infrastructure
* Hydrologic locations of monitoring stations and data
* Meteorological monitoring stations and data
* Elevation data
* Water table / aquifer data
* Rainfall forecast

**Ground water level monitoring**:: Groundwater level monitoring networks are
deployed on the field to monitor Aquifer status. A groundwater specialist needs
to be able to traverse links from the Well to the piezomter deployed and,
furthermore to the acquired observation (timeseries).

*Relevant datasets*:::
* Groundwater wells description
* Piezometer description
* Groundwater levels at piezometer level

**Surface-ground water networks interaction**:: Management of the pressures on
natural resources requires properly linking domain features not only using
surface/ground water interaction at a local level but also taking benefit of
the broader river networks and aquifer systems connectivity.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* Borehole/Well
* Piezometer (+ associated observations)
* Aquifer
* AquiferSystem
* Aquifer/River interaction
* River Network
* River
* gage (+ associated observations)

**Surface water impacted groundwater level forecasting**:: A groundwater
extraction modeler needs information about surface water that replenishes
groundwater so they can understand and forecast groundwater availability.

*Relevant datasets*:::
* Groundwater wells and level data
* Surface watervmonitoring sites and flow data
* Meteorological monitoring sites and observations
* Output predictions at groundwater prediction wells
