<h2 id="Overview"><a class="anchor" href="#Overview"></a>5. Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Environmental Linked Feature Interoperability Experiment (ELFIE) is intended
to test existing OGC and W3C standards with the goal of
establishing a best practice for exposing links between and among environmental
domain and sampling features. The IE is focused on two cross-domain use cases:
1) encoding topological and domain specific relationships between features
and 2) description of observations available for and linked to sampled domain
features. While addressing these use cases, the IE will strive to address issues
of encoding specific (simplified and useful) <em>views</em> of a rich (complete but
complicated) linked data graph that could be passed
between systems. These linked data graph <em>views</em> are expected to support
architectures involving linked data catalogs and registries. For example, data
providers can use the linked data graph <em>views</em> as a way to advertise their
monitoring or domain features to catalogs or other applications that want to
crawl and index available data. Similarly, integrated catalogs that index and
construct links between features can use the <em>views</em> as a linked data response to
search queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Current OGC services, while flexible and capable, do not allow exposure of
features in a resource oriented way and provide opaque interfaces to structured
and/or inter-related content. The encodings demonstrated in ELFIE turn the
normal OGC service pattern (GetCapabilities followed by introspection to
understand contents) inside out by encoding associations between features as
linked data predicates. This approach uses subject-predicate-object triples to
describe resource-relation-resource associations where the resources may be OGC web service
requests. This leverages the power of services such as WFS to provide feature
instances, but expresses the structure of complex features or cross-service
associated features explicitly. The scope of this work could have easily gotten
out of control. To focus the work, the IE attempted to avoid issues not directly
related to encoding linked data documents as would be passed from server to
client via http.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described in detail later, the IE has specified a number of
<a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">contexts</a>
that describe useful linked data graph <em>views</em>. JSON-LD documents that rely on
these contexts could be delivered using the <code>view</code> pattern as described by the
<a href="https://github.com/UKGovLD/linked-data-api/blob/wiki/API_Query_Parameters.md">Linked Data API</a>
or as the payload returned from a REST API endpoint. Using this
approach, the recommendation takes advantage of the power and flexibility of
Linked Open Data while providing just enough guidance to foster
interoperability. By describing a partially resolve useful <em>view</em> of a linked data
graph, it also allows resources that are important but not yet available as
formal linked open data to be incorporated into a linked data system. This
mechanism should provide a gateway to inclusion in and understanding the value
of the Linked Open Data cloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ie_summary"><a class="anchor" href="#_ie_summary"></a>5.1. IE Summary</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The experiment conducted in ELFIE tested the assumption that broadly adopted
web technologies for linked data could be applied to environmental linked
feature use cases to satisfy the needs of a number of compelling use cases.
The <a href="#Objectives">Objectives</a> section describes engineering design goals and details the
assumptions and scope that were used to constrain the magnitude of the IE.
Much of the IE was a thought experiment among participants where use cases
were discussed and potential technologies and implementations were explored.
The <a href="#Use_Cases">Use Case Summary</a> section describes these use cases and a select set that were
implemented to more thoroughly test and evolve the technologies that were
selected during design discussions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The technologies tested in ELFIE were selected for their adoptability,
commonality, and suitability to the needs of ELFIE use cases. New and
thus uncommon domain feature models were applied with the chosen, more common,
technologies. The <a href="#Standards_Best_Practices">Applicable Best Practices and Standards</a> section is a brief discussion of the technologies
and standards tested in ELFIE. The technology chosen to provide a precise
but not overly prescriptive description of the linked data graph <em>views</em> is
the JSON-LD context. Details of the contexts defined in the ELFIE project are
discussed in the <a href="#Relations_Contexts">Relations and JSON-LD Contexts</a> section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The outcomes of ELFIE provide guidance for providing <em>views</em> of environmental
features. A simple <em>view</em> intended to be a preview, suitable for basic indexing
is specified. The IE also experimented with <em>views</em> intended to provide
topological as well as observational and domain feature model relationships.
The preview <em>view</em> was largely successful, but there was no one satisfactory
solution for expression of a preview geometry. The experimentation with domain
feature models led to the conclusion that the underlying linked data
technologies are mature enough, but progress is still needed on domain feature
ontologies and publication of domain feature model data using them. These issues
are discussed in more detail in the <a href="#Experiment_Outcomes_Summary">Summary of Experiment and Analysis of Outcomes</a> and
<a href="#Issues_Recommendations">Issues and Recommendations for Future Work.</a> sections.</p>

<p>The ELFIE explored a number of interesting but tangential topics. Annex A: <a href="#ontology_from_uml">Strategies for Publishing Domain Ontologies as Linked Data from OGC domain standards</a>

ontology from a UML model. Annex B: <a href="#linked_data_default">Default Response for Multiple Representions and Relations</a> is a brief discussion of issues related

<p>Functional goals of ELFIE focused on the description and use of links

observations data that describe the features. Within this, ELFIE aimed to
leverage existing standards and best practices while maintaining a high

users with a wide array of technical skill levels. Combining these goals
led to IE participants to seek solutions that</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To test the assumptions described above, a number of example use cases
(described below) were used to guide discussion and testing of potential
technical solutions. The use cases were hypothetical, clearly of value to
the domain, and technically difficult using existing technologies and
practices. Discussion of use cases was predicated on the assumption that
these use cases would be implemented as test cases under the IE. While
time and resources did not allow all these use cases to be implemented for
ELFIE, the use cases provided invaluable context and example systems to
guide discussion and vetting of design alternatives.</p>

<p>The specifics of technologies and practices the IE tested are described
below. With a clear direction, participants implemented test documents and
code to exercise and demonstrate the IE outcomes. Applying some of the use
cases considered in the design phase led to some refinement to the design,
but the design selected largely satisfied the goals of the IE with some
clear next steps and further work needed to formalize data models,
encodings, and best practices. The experiment succeeded in identifying
shortcomings of some existing practices and gaps in the standards base
line that need to be filled. Putting further work and needed new work

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach taken in ELFIE was limited in contrast to recent IEs concerning
environmental information models. ELFIE focused on linked data documents that
contain collections of linked features and related observations. With regard
to the OGC Reference Model, the IE seeks to understand how features
(geospatial information) can be linked to each other in fully dereferenced
documents or by reference through use of HTTP URIs. ELFIE did not seek to
solve problems regarding network architecture for resolving links or systems
design and governance for applications that store and retrieving links or
concept relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given this, ELFIE sought to define a common approach to encoding links
between and among environmental domain features that would allow cross-domain
and cross-system sharing and interoperability of such linked information. To
do this, ELFIE worked with existing and pending OGC standards for encoding of
environmental observation data in an integrated dataset of features. Such OGC
data models were then linked together according to W3C and other Linked Data
best practices.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ogc_web_standards"><a class="anchor" href="#_ogc_web_standards"></a>8.2. OGC Web Standards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OGC Web Service standards for features and observations (WFS and SOS
respectively) were used to construct HTTP URLs for use in ELFIE linked data
documents as much as possible. While the WFS and SOS APIs present some
challenges in creating URLs for use in linked data, the APIs do offer
sufficient HTTP GET functionality to embed useful content in linked data with
a great degree of flexibility. Issues related to URL structure and a given
API-call&#8217;s relation to a canonical non-information resource URI were
encountered but deferred for future investigations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ogc_domain_models"><a class="anchor" href="#_ogc_domain_models"></a>8.3. OGC Domain Models</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OGC data models were used extensively in ELFIE. The Observations and
Measurements (O&amp;M) conceptual model provided a high level organizing
framework for most ELFIE documents. The OGC-W3C Spatial Data On the Web
Working Group implementation of O&amp;M (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and
Actuator (SOSA)) was used directly because of its applicability to the linked
data technology pursued in ELFIE. Geosparql ontology was also used directly for
representing geometries and spatial relations between features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domain specific data models such as WaterML2 Part 3: Surface Hydrologic
Features and WaterML2 Part 4: Groundwater Markup Language 2 (GWML2) were also
used for feature types and relations in ELFIE linked data documents. A major
limitation for use of these data models in ELFIE was a lack of published
taxonomies and ontologies of their feature types and relations;
experimental content was generated for ELFIE and formalization of such
taxonomies and ontologies was left for future work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_w3c"><a class="anchor" href="#_w3c"></a>8.4. W3C</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>W3C best practices for data on the web, spatial data in the web, and linked
data were used to guide decisions related to ELFIE linked data documents.
Several members of the ELFIE project team were involved in development of
these best practices and represented them throughout the project. Given this,
the ELFIE was an opportunity to apply these best practices in a practical
engineering process, using them together and attempting to apply them to OGC
web service and information models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was largely successful and no major issues were encountered related to
the best practices themselves. However, they were not achieved fully due to
realities of the internet, organization&#8217;s operational constraints, and
limitations of current APIs and data models. In other words, a project
seeking to apply OGC standards on their current infrastructure within the
suggested W3C best practices would find it very difficult or expensive to
achieve them.</p>

<p>Given ELFIE goals related to adoptability of outcomes and
applicability to mass market search, JSON-LD was used as the encoding for
ELFIE documents. For a better search accessibility, Schema.org ontology was used
to provide basic description for the features. While there were other potential
options that could be used,
the ease of use (parsing and serialization) of JSON-LD across practically
all programming languages made it the clear choice for use in ELFIE. As
described below, some technical limitations inherent to RDF and thus JSON-LD
were encountered while attempting to encode preview geometries, but all basic
requirements of ELFIE were satisfied by the JSON-LD encoding.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important goal of the ELFIE was adoptability by web developers and
compatibility with technologies that are ubiquitous on the internet. Given these
goals, the IE team started to think in terms of "views" of the linked data graph
describing a given environmental feature or observation. Two conceptual views,
preview and network, were the primary focus on ELFIE. Preview is meant to be
a very simple summary of a feature including type, name, and geometry. Network
is meant to be a summary of relevant first-neighbor features in a topological
network. These two views form the core interoperable set of ELFIE "views" but
lack domain specific relations such as observational relations and hydrologic
topology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initial ELFIE discussions of the graph "view" concept used the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/">Shapes Constraint Language SHACL</a> technology as the
logical implementation. Further evaluation and consideration of ELFIE goals
around adoptability and ubiquity, the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a> was chosen as the
most appropriate technical solution to express the graph "views". ELFIE contexts
are meant to be precise descriptions of what the IE found to be the most
appropriate linked data properties (attributes and relations) and types. They
are not intended to be used as a schema to specify or validate the contents of a
given document. However, they could provide a useful set of aliases for the only
types and properties that could be parsed and interpreted by the client. From a
practical perspective, the contexts provide clear guidelines for what properties
and types to use while not being overly prescriptive, limiting, or difficult to
use in a typical web development workflow.</p>

<p>GeoJSON-LD[<a href="http://geojson.org/geojson-ld/" class="bare">http://geojson.org/geojson-ld/</a>] was
seen as a logical solution, but as described in the outstanding issues for
GeoJSON-LD[<a href="http://geojson.org/geojson-ld/" class="bare">http://geojson.org/geojson-ld/</a>], nested GeoJSON coordinate arrays
are not supported by JSON-LD parsers. Additionally, the schema.org geometry
schema was seen as bring under specified in that among other minor reasons,
it does not provide a default coordinate reference system or a mechanism to
declare one. For this reason, the geosparql well known text format was included
providing a precise and JSON-LD compatible geometry format. However, if some
logical assumptions are made for the use of schema.org geometry, it can be used
to satisfy the basic geometry preview use case with significantly lower technical
overhead than support for the full well known text standard. Further work should
look more closely at this issue in an attempt to reconcile and or provide guidance.</p>

<h2 id="Experiment_Outcomes_Summary"><a class="anchor" href="#Experiment_Outcomes_Summary"></a>10. Summary of Experiment and Analysis of Outcomes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described previously, The ELFIE was intended to test existing OGC and W3C
standards with the goal of establishing a best practice for exposing links
between and among environmental domain and sampling features. The project
sought to test existing solutions to linking data on the web with a "just
enough" semantic annotation approach that would be approachable by developers
and adoptable existing systems. Many use cases were discussed and a few of them
were selected for experimental implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All experimental implementations are summarized on the
<a href="https://opengeospatial.github.io/ELFIE/">ELFIE demo pages.</a> The collection of
experiments show that existing practices for encoding linked data can be used
to satisfy the important environmental linked features use cases considered by
ELFIE. In cases where features and related information were already published
as linked data or had well established web services, these data and/or service-
generated representations were easy to incorporate and use. Many of the core
linked data relations used for search engine optimization were found to be
suited to typical environmental linked feature use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_future_work"><a class="anchor" href="#_future_work"></a>10.1. Future Work</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The experiments exposed several issues with existing and new technologies
that need to be addressed to realize the full potential of the core linked
encoding technologies tested. The issue of representation of a preview geometry
for a feature should be addressed and seems to be a tractable problem that could
lead to significant benefits. Another tractable and important issue is creation
of ontologies for domain features. As of the completion of ELFIE, this work was
already being undertaken for existing domain models where a UML to OWL conversion
is possible. Other domain models, such as flood impact features, need to be
created and or vetted by a community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were also several issues highlighted by the ELFIE that were deemed out of
scope and purposefully left for future efforts. The foundational issue in this
category is the "landing page" or "default representation" problem. That is,
how should we handle the case where a dereferencable URI meant to identify a
real world entity with multiple digital representations. There are many related
issues largely related to the network architecture and expected behavior when
dereferencing URIs. These were generally out of scope for ELFIE but need to
be addressed to achieve interoperability and include: URI structure,
use of non-information URIs with WFS and other services, strategies for managing
collections of potentially temporary linked data among many data providers.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OGC Environmental Linked Features Interoperability Experiment (ELFIE) has
explored publishing environmental observations as linked data, with data
interpretation supported by having unambiguous references to key domain concepts
in the data represented by additional links (URIs). Such concepts cover the
nature of the properties of a data object, but also the key Use Case of linking
an observation to the Feature of Interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parallel to this activity, members from several OGC SWGs (GeoSciML, Groundwater,
Hydrologic Features) are attempting to ‘port’ the initial work done using ISO
191xx series UML paradigm to OWL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taking the opportunity of having all the involved parties available during the
2018 Orléans TC an ad’hoc meeting was organized on March 2018 23rd.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document builds on those joint discussions in order to share best
practices. It is shared under GeoSciML SWG GitHub repository
(<a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoSciML/tree/master/documents" class="bare">https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoSciML/tree/master/documents</a> ).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_problem_statement"><a class="anchor" href="#_problem_statement"></a>12.1. Problem statement</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Common semantics for the description of key domain concepts and the type of
observations’ the Feature of Interest are identified by using published models –
such as HY_Features, GWML, GeoSciML. These models (currently) are available in a
normative forms as UML notation, and in some cases as XML schema, neither of
which is conducive to easily dereference a URI for a concept to get more detail
about that specific concept, or even to confidently match the identity of any
references to concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The requirement therefore is to be able to publish such models, as stable URIs,
dereferencing as fine-grained Linked Data. This means that a predictable and
human readable URI naming scheme for elements in a model is required. (this may
not be strictly necessary for a single model, but when a body of such models are
managed by a single authority – such as OGC and its delegated Specification
Working Groups – then commonality is necessary to avoid revisiting the naming
strategy for each case, and to allow users to become familiar and comfortable
with a consistent product.) Within ELFIE context the need has been identified
for at least two models, HY_Features and GWML2, and their multiple component
Application Schemas.  The GeoSciML community is also looking at the same issues.
There is a need for both efficiency and consistency to harmonise and document a
common approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ISO 19150-2 defines a set of rules for encoding UML as an OWL ontology
referencing the suite of OWL artefacts created to model the ISO Harmonised
Model.  This form of OWL has an unknown utility – by tying data types and
concepts into the extensive ISO model this adds a high burden on clients to
reason over the entire model (quite a large set of content) in order to identify
fairly simple, but highly important, semantic baseline information – such as
that a property may be treated as a xsd:integer for purposes of a calculation).
The feasibility of such reasoning is unknown, as there is no way yet to test the
ISO models behave as expected under reasoning conditions.  Furthermore, for the
purposes of Linked Data, much of the modelling of behavior of low-level data
types is not relevant, when the main requirement is to identify concepts, access
explanations, or potentially access information about implementations of these
concepts that may be available.  Finally, from the perspective of infrastructure
support, OGC provides a “definitions server” that is designed around SKOS
meta-model and will provide dereferencing services and Linked Data
representations.</p>

<h3 id="_background"><a class="anchor" href="#_background"></a>12.2. Background</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BRGM and GSC have performed an initial analysis of the issues and questions that
arise in the context of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generating ontologies for a subset of GeoSciML: GeoSciML Basic, Borehole and
Lite,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing populating instances for Boreholes, Geologic Units pointing to vocabs
when available (FR, EU, CGI GTWG) and testing some representations (maps,
graph).”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output of that exercise has been shared under BRGM repository

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Identified issues and questions are relevant to the equivalent challenges for
ELFIE, and collaboration with the GeoSciML, GWML, HY_Features and ELFIE
activities has been initiated to develop a common solution. Those elements have
then been further characterized from the perspective of definition publication
process and governance.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_proposed_strategy"><a class="anchor" href="#_proposed_strategy"></a>12.3. Proposed strategy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Resources, time and testing methodology for “hand building” optimal equivalent ontologies are not available (notwithstanding comments that these may lead to iterative refinement and improvement of the model).
The only automated pathway available to all participants currently is using Shapechange (<a href="http://shapechange.net" class="bare">http://shapechange.net</a>), which means developing a set of encoding rules from a wide range of choices and options from previous experiments in encoding different styles of UML model.
The ISO 19150-2 artefacts will be seen as an intermediate artefact available by an annotation property reference in the metadata describing the provenance of the ontology. For such perspective the use of PROV-O should be used.
“Manual interventions” to artefact to correct bugs or apply further rules will be encoded as RDF transformations or additional statements that can be applied in sequence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process can be summarized like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If necessary, rules to extract basic OWL and xsd: datatype equivalence, without embedded reference to ISO datatypes will be developed and applied as part of OGC-NA infrastructure.
Rules to extract SKOS equivalent glossary/taxonomy from OWL class models  will be developed and applied as part of OGC-NA infrastructure.
URIs under www.opengis.net/def will be assigned, and content will be marked as draft, as an exercise in publication governance by OGC-NA, to make content and process available for wider discussion.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The rules of ISO 19150-2 restrict the resulting ontologies to the way UML metamodel works . Respecting all of the 19150-2 means we don’t take into account the open world assumption when working with ontologies (missing a piece of information doesn’t mean that piece of information is false). For instance, placeholder properties or classes in UML are transformed to OWL properties and classes where there is no need for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transformation rules are consistent but limits the resulting ontologies to the UML paradigm. Some additional work may be done on the resulting ontologies to add semantics between classes (disjunctions, subsumption, equivalence, etc) and within or between properties (functional properties, transitive properties, symmetric properties, inverse of, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No specific indications about association classes are mentioned in the norm. It is obvious that an association class is translated as an OWL class. No rule for linking this class to the related class(es) appear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Union: 19150-2 recommends to use owl:UnionOf, the implementation in ShapeChange seems rather to stick to 19118 approach (disjoint union) but does it in a very complex way. Instead, owl:disjointUnionOf shall be used. This should generate a ChangeRequest to 19150-2</p>

<h4 id="_property_names_and_definitions"><a class="anchor" href="#_property_names_and_definitions"></a>12.4.3. Property names and definitions</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Properties naming when translating attributes: dots in properties identifiers could be interpreted somehow that they are still scoped to classes, while in ontologies, properties are scoped to a namespace instead. Properties are independent entities that may or may not have a specific class as a domain. This is one major structural difference between UML and OWL.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use general (non-scoped to class) property names when the name of the attribute or association is unique. Thus, leave the domain of the properties open (or typed as owl:Thing). The restrictions on the properties values in the class definition can be used for this purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there is an ambiguïty, allow scoped names for properties (class.Property) then verify whether</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>automatically created properties can be merged into one (eg. GeologicFeature.purpose and EarthMaterial.purpose).</p>

</li>
<li>

SWE related issues
There is no direct SWE ontology but several concepts from SWE can be found elsewhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reference to basic SWE types must be modified if needed by specialized Classes from other ontologies or by defining new ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use GSML_QuantityRange instead of swe:QuantityRange as recommended in GeoSciML definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename swe:Category  to  skos:Concept or mdl:Lineage (depending on the case) and swe:Quantity to the relevant class in the context (ts:TimePosition, mdq:PositionalAccuracy, etc.).
Preparing for application ontologies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enable GeoSciML Basic and Borehole properties to be reused in application ontologies like GeoSciML Lite, we activate the ShapeChange rule “rule-owl-prop-globalScopeByUniquePropertyName” that scopes unique name property to global use, and thus not specify the domain of these properties. The scoping of the properties to their classes in Basic and Borehole is done using restrictions on the values that these properties can take for their corresponding classes. This can be done thanks to the ShapeChange rule “rule-owl-prop-range-local-withUniversalQuantification”.
UML constraints
In the considered standards, constraints are expressed in non-canonical forms in the UML classes definitions or in OCL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirements of the model cannot be all respected in the ontology representation (eg. “QuantityRange properties that must report a single value SHALL assign both lower and upper value as equal to that single value.”). This should be checked and translated manually as restrictions (owl:Restriction, other classes axioms, properties relations, …) when possible afterwards.
Implementation choices for specific communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ShapeChange “Map entries” provide a flexible way to choose recommended names for properties and classes. This would enable one to reuse existing specialized classes and properties from external ontologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GeologicUnitView contains mixed information from both GeologicUnit and MappedFeature. A decision must be made to which entity the view must be associated (using the same URI as the GeologicUnit or MappedFeature )</p>

<li>
<p>Abstract class : According to ISO 19150-2, abstract classes in UML are transformed to annotated owl class. But in GSMLsome abstract classes were created to provide an extension point for GSML extension (ex: FoliationAbstractDescription); they provided a bag to list properties. Some might then be revisited/deleted (the only reason to keep them would be for schema mapping purposes but we considered it a low priority use case compared to LinkedOpenData, Websem reasoning)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expressiveness of ontology languages should be used to enrich the reasoning: axioms on classes (equivalence, disjointness), and properties relations (inverse, equivalence) and characteristics (transitivity, symmetry, functionality and inverse functionality ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UML class union should be transformed using owl:disjointUnionOf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rob : The key meta-model issue I see here is the use of a character string (UML option) to hold an IRI in a particular implementation profile - and the trickiness of modelling this as an objectProperty or not. Option could be to model it as an rdfs:Property, and allow implementation profiles to constrain it to an owl:ObjectProperty.</p>

<p>Association classes must be handled differently: ShapeChange transforms an association class into separate class and properties. Thus, no link is created between the association class and the classes that are initially related by it in the UML. No rule is found in ShapeChange to handle that.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This must be defined afterwards with two properties: associationSource and associationTarget (exactly as in passing from conceptual model to a logical schema). As a solution, this could be locally defined as <span class="association name">”Source” and [association name]</span>”Target”. These two properties must have the right domain and range. The direct property between the source and the target automatically created by Shapechange must be deleted.</p>

<p>When a UML class from another schema is referenced (Observation class for example ), it should be replaced by the specialized classes from the ontology of that schema (could be automated in ShapeChange).

<p>Usage of skos VS dedicated classes when transforming <a href="#codeList">[codeList]</a> from the UML: The pattern proposed by ISO-19150-2 is to create a class for each property designed to hold a “term”.  This class shall be a subtype of skos::Concept according to the spec.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Non information resource identifiers, URIs that are an identifier for a thing
that may or may not have information representations, are useful to provide
persistent and reusable identifiers for entities such as real-world features.
These non information resource identifiers provide a means for global
identification across a system such that multiple members of the system can
contain information about and/or in reference to shared entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a basic conundrum with non information resource identifiers in that
there can only be one default response when derefencing a URI and only one member
of a distributed system can be the source of that default response. Further, in
order to achieve linked system interoperability, dereferencing behavior of non
information resource URIs needs to be in accord with the expectations of a
member node of a system. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPRange-14">httpRange-14</a>
and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/">Cool URIs Technical Report</a> provide a
significant basis for solving this conundrum and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg">W3C
working groups continue to focus on it</a>, but many details remain to be agreed
upon for use cases such as are being pursued by the ELFIE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While details of the default dereferencing behavior of non information resource
identifiers and subsequent redirects to information resources was discussed in
the ELFIE, the IE has attempted to focus on encoding of linked data information
resources rather than the network behavior for discovery and retrieval of
non-information resources. Future work and best practice development will be
needed to address these issues:</p>
